# E-commerce website
Simulated e-commerce website where users can search, browse, add items to the cart, and order. On the cart page, the user can modify the number of items, delete items in the cart, and see the total cost including shipping fee and tax. After the order is placed, the user can check their order history on a separate page. This website can be seen at <a href="https://makih2003.github.io/ecommerce-web/

## Reflection
I built this project after I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript outside of class by myself during my first year of the computer science program.
### What I learnt
• Building a website with multiple pages that interact with others<br>
• Working with local storage<br>
• Using important CSS features such as Flexbox and Grid<br>
